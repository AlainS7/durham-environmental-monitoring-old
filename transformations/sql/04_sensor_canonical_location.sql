-- Compute a per-sensor canonical location to stabilize mapping when minor jitter occurs.
-- Strategy:
--  - Consider the last 90 days up to @proc_date
--  - For each sensor, derive daily distinct rounded positions (ROUND to 5 decimals ~1m)
--  - Choose the most frequent rounded position (mode); tie-breaker = most recent day seen
--  - Output canonical_latitude/longitude and a GEOGRAPHY point
