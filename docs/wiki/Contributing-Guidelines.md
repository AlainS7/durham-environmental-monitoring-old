# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Hot Durham Environmental Monitoring System! This document outlines how to contribute effectively to the project.

## ü§ù Ways to Contribute

### Code Contributions
* Bug fixes and improvements
* New features and enhancements
* Performance optimizations
* Documentation updates
* Test coverage improvements

### Non-Code Contributions
* Bug reports and feature requests
* Documentation improvements
* User experience feedback
* Community support
* Translation assistance

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

First, fork the repository and clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hot-durham.git
cd hot-durham
```

Set up your development environment:

```bash
# Preferred (uv)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync requirements.txt
uv pip sync requirements-dev.txt

# Or classic virtualenv + pip
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow Python PEP 8 standards with some project-specific conventions:

* **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
* **Indentation**: 4 spaces
* **Naming Conventions**:
  * Classes: `PascalCase`
  * Functions/methods: `snake_case`
  * Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  * Files: `snake_case.py`

### Code Formatting

We use automated code formatting tools:

```bash
# Install formatting tools
pip install black isort flake8

# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check code quality
flake8 .
```

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

* **Unit Tests**: For individual functions/classes
* **Integration Tests**: For system components
* **End-to-End Tests**: For complete workflows

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_specific_module.py
```

### Documentation

* Update docstrings for all new functions/classes
* Follow Google-style docstring format
* Update relevant wiki pages
* Include inline comments for complex logic

Example docstring:

```python
def process_sensor_data(data: dict, sensor_type: str) -> dict:
    """Process raw sensor data into standardized format.
    
    Args:
        data: Raw sensor data dictionary
        sensor_type: Type of sensor ('temperature', 'humidity', etc.)
        
    Returns:
        Processed data dictionary with standardized fields
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If sensor_type is not supported
        KeyError: If required data fields are missing
    """
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Your Contribution

Before starting work:

### 2. Implementation

* Write clean, readable code
* Follow existing patterns and conventions
* Add comprehensive tests
* Update documentation as needed
* Commit frequently with clear messages

### 3. Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add temperature anomaly detection algorithm"
git commit -m "Fix API rate limiting issue in weather data fetcher"
git commit -m "Update dashboard UI for mobile responsiveness"

git commit -m "feat: add real-time alert system"
git commit -m "fix: resolve database connection timeout"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```
